                Your website is often the first impression potential customers
                have of your brand. It&apos;s your digital storefront, your
                business card, and your sales pitch all rolled into one. But no
                matter how beautiful your site looks, if it&apos;s not
                user-friendly, you&apos;ll struggle to turn visitors into

                  A cluttered website overwhelms visitors and makes it difficult
                  for them to find what they&apos;re looking for. Focus on
                  simplicity—use plenty of white space, stick to a consistent
                  color scheme, and ensure your design is clean and
                  straightforward. The goal is to make navigation intuitive, so
                  users can easily find the information they need without
                  feeling lost.

                  With more people browsing on their phones than ever before,
                  having a mobile-friendly website is non-negotiable. Ensure

                  to any screen size, whether it&apos;s a smartphone, tablet, or

                  your content. Optimize your images, minimize code, and
                  consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to ensure your
                  website loads quickly. Aim for a load time of under three
